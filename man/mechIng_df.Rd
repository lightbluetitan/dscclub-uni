\title{Mechanical engineering dataset for ordered isotonic regression}
\format{
A data frame with 1495 observations and 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{x}{Numeric variable used in the analysis (numeric)}
  \item{g1}{Numeric variable used in the analysis (numeric)}
  \item{g2}{Numeric variable used in the analysis (numeric)}
}
}
\source{
Data taken from the \pkg{OrdMonReg} package version 1.0.3
}
\usage{
data(mechIng_df)
}
\description{
This dataset, mechIng_df, is a data frame containing measurements used to illustrate
ordered isotonic regression in mechanical engineering. It includes three numeric variables
that were analyzed in Balabdaoui et al. (2009).
}
\details{
The dataset name has been kept as 'mechIng_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets
in the R ecosystem. This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
DSCUNIDataSets package and assists users in identifying its specific characteristics.
The suffix 'df' indicates that the dataset is a data frame object. The original content has not been modified
in any way.
