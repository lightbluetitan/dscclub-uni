\description{
This dataset, bolts_df, is a data frame containing data from an experiment on the effects
of machine adjustments on the time required to count bolts. It includes both integer and factor
variables representing different experimental conditions and measurements.

\details{
The dataset name has been kept as 'bolts_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets
in the R ecosystem. This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
DSCUNIDataSets package and assists users in identifying its specific characteristics.
The suffix 'df' indicates that the dataset is a data frame object. The original content has not been modified
in any way.
